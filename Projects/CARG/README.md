# 🔌 CARG — Carbon-Aware Reasoning Gate

**CARG** is a decision-routing framework that dynamically selects *how much cognitive effort* a system should apply to a problem, based on:

- 🌡️ **Task Complexity**
- ⚡ **Energy Availability**
- 🎯 **User Intent**

It's a philosophy wrapped in a logic gate: AI shouldn't always think maximally—it should think *appropriately*.

| Mode | Name                    | When Used                                | Simulated Cost |
|------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| R1   | Fast Heuristics         | Low complexity, casual intent            | 💨 Low (1)     |
| R2   | Moderate Reasoning      | Balanced or energy-constrained tasks     | 🌬 Medium (3)  |
| R3   | Full Deductive Logic    | High complexity & high energy available  | 🔥 High (6)    |
