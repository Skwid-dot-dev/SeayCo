# ðŸŒ± SeayCo â€” Ethical Intelligence. Open By Design.

**SeayCo** is an open-source lab exploring how to make AI think more *ethically*, *transparently*, and *resource-consciously*. I believe intelligence isn't just about answersâ€”it's about impact.

This monorepo collects projects that ask big questions and build real tools to address them.

## ðŸ“¦ Projects

- [`projects/CARG`](./projects/CARG)  
  **Carbon-Aware Reasoning Gate** â€” a logic system that chooses *how deeply* AI should think based on task complexity, user intent, and environmental cost. Cognitive efficiency meets ethical throttling.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Build

I believe:

- AI should *reason with restraint* as much as it reasons with power.
- Memory, personality, and emotional context are just as important as math.
- Tools worth using should be *freely available to everyone*.

Every project here is a thought experiment with a working prototype.
